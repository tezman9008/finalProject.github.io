This is a simple website to look up game statistics, game sprites, and element types of specific pokemon as listed in the free public Pokemon API

For non-pokemon followers, there is a random search button that will return a random pokemon from the API

Both buttons operate off the same search function to determine the information, which essentially searchs for information and appends this to the DOM

The main search function uses loops to determine the pokemon ID in the API based off the user's pokemon name search.

Loops were also used to determine an array of game statistics and element types of pokemon, which would later be added and presented as an object
The random function calls on the main search function, but inserts a random number as the ID for the search function

Challenges in this project were non-technical (Time management), largely due to competing work schedules

Wish list for this project would be to include locations of the searched pokemon in the game, and functions to save the searched pokemon into a team and determine the overall strength of the team.
