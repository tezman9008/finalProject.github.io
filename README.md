#This is a simple website to look up game statistics, game sprites, and element types of specific pokemon as listed in the free public Pokemon API

#For non-pokemon followers, there is a random search button that will return a random pokemon from the API

#The buttons operate off the same search function to determine the information

#Loops were used to determine an array of game statistics and element types of pokemon, which would later be added and presented as an object

#Challenges in this project were non-technical (Time management), largely due to competing work schedules

#Wish list for this project would have also included locations of the searched pokemon in the game, and functions to save the searched pokemon into a team and determine the overall strength of the team.
